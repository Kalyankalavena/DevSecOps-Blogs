## 🐙 I. GitHub Account Creation

### 💡 Why is a GitHub account important?

GitHub helps you save, share, and manage your code online—great for working alone or with a team.

### ✅ Steps:

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and click **“Sign up.”**
2. Use a professional email address.
3. Create a strong password:

   * 15+ characters (any combo), or
   * At least 8 characters with 1 number + 1 lowercase letter
4. Pick a username (used in Git commands too).
5. Solve CAPTCHA and verify email.
6. Click your profile picture (top right) to view your username.

## 💽 II. Installing Git

### 💡 What is Git?

Git tracks code changes on your computer. GitHub stores those changes online.

### ✅ Steps:

1. Search **“Git Download”** in your browser.
2. Open the official site and download Git for your OS (Windows, Mac, etc.).
3. Run the installer (`.exe` file on Windows).
4. Click **Next** on all steps to keep default settings.
5. When prompted, select:

   ```
   Use Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software.
   ```
6. Click **Install** and let it finish setup.

## 🔗 III. Linking Git to GitHub

Now connect Git (your computer) with GitHub (online) so you can push code to the cloud.

### ✅ Steps:

1. Open **Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac).
2. Run the following commands (replace with your info):

```bash
git config --global user.name "YourGitHubUsername"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

3. Use double quotes to avoid errors.
4. Verify your config:

```bash
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

If both return correct info—you’re connected!

## 📌 TL;DR:

* Sign up for GitHub
* Install Git
* Link them using `git config` commands
* You’re now ready to manage code like a pro!

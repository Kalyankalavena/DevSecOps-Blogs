 Git Workflow & Command Compendium
Writtenby Kalyan Kalavena

🧠 1. What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development. Here's what that really means:

Control System: Git tracks every version of your files through commits. Each change gets a unique ID, making it easy to roll back or audit history.

Revision: You can work on multiple branches simultaneously — different features, bug fixes, or versions.

Distributed: Every contributor has a full copy of the codebase and history on their own system, enabling offline work and safe backups.

Git is like a time machine for code — every step is recorded, restorable, and shareable.

🔀 2. Merge Strategies in Git
Git supports two powerful ways to integrate code: Merge and Rebase.

✅ 2.1 Classic Merge
Involves switching to the target branch, pulling the latest, and merging a feature branch into it.

This always generates a merge commit, even if there are no conflicts.

Useful when multiple developers are collaborating on shared branches.

Downside: Creates extra commits, making history noisy.

🧹 2.2 Rebase
Rewrites history by placing your branch on top of the target branch — clean and linear.

No extra commits. It simplifies debugging and reviewing changes.

Recommended for: Solo development or private feature branches.

🌐 3. Remote Merge Strategies (When Pushing to GitHub/GitLab)
🚫 No Fast-Forward (--no-ff)
Always creates a merge commit.

Ensures visibility of merges but can clutter history.

✅ Fast-Forward (--ff)
If the source branch is up-to-date, the target simply moves forward without a merge commit.

🛑 Fast-Forward Only (--ff-only)
Rejects the merge if the source branch is behind the target.

Ensures a clean, linear history by requiring a rebase before merging.

🌲 4. Branching Models: Traditional vs Agile
🧱 4.1 GitFlow (Traditional Model)
Branches: main, develop, release, hotfix, etc.

Works well for projects with long release cycles (e.g., quarterly releases).

Downsides: Complex, high maintenance, often leads to merge conflicts.

⚡ 4.2 Modern Agile Model
Minimal branching: Only integration and feature branches.

Feature branches are rebased onto integration before PRs.

CI/CD pipelines handle building, testing, scanning, and deploying automatically.

Integration branch is always production-ready.

In Agile, simpler branching = faster delivery = fewer bugs = happier teams.

💼 5. DevOps: From Support to Strategic Role
Modern DevOps isn't just about infrastructure. It's about enforcing best practices:

Setting Git strategies

Creating secure and optimized CI/CD pipelines

Guiding developers on branching, automation, and deployments

Every developer now needs to understand:

Basic Git and Linux commands

CI/CD principles

Microservices and automation tools

🧾 6. Key Takeaways
Use Rebase for cleaner history on private branches.

Enforce Fast-Forward Only merges to keep your main branch clean.

Avoid unnecessary long-lived branches.

Automate everything — tests, scans, builds, deploys.

Practice regularly to gain Git fluency.

Embrace DevOps and Agile mindset — it's not optional anymore.

# 🌐 Git Beyond the Clouds: How Your Code Travels the World Securely

**🛠 Git, Cloud & Bitbucket: A Practical DevOps Guide by Kalyan Kalavena**

If you're stepping into the DevOps or cloud world, you've probably heard terms like **Git, Bitbucket, Cloud VMs, SSH, AWS, Google Cloud** — sounds like a buffet of tech buzzwords, right?

Don't panic. Here’s your no-fluff guide to how it all fits together 👇

## 🧠 Why Version Control Systems Like Git Are a Game Changer

Ever lost a file or messed up code and wished for a *rewind* button?

Welcome to **Version Control Systems (VCS)** — your personal time machine and team collaborator. They:

- 🕓 Track every single change in your project.
- 👥 Let multiple people work together, conflict-free.
- ⏮ Allow easy rollback to previous versions (yep, no drama).

### 🪜 VCS Evolution 101

| Generation | System Type | Limitation |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| 1st Gen   | Locking Systems | Only one person edits at a time |
| 2nd Gen   | Centralized (like SVN) | No offline access or local history |
| 3rd Gen   | Distributed (like Git) | Full history on every machine, works offline 🚀 |

Git wins — fast, secure, collaborative.

## 🛠 Must-Know Git Commands (Your Cheat Sheet)

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `git init` | Initialize a Git repo |
| `git add <file>` | Stage a file |
| `git commit -m "msg"` | Save changes with a message |
| `git push origin master` | Upload code to the remote repo |
| `git status` | View file changes |
| `git log` | See commit history |
| `.gitignore` | Ignore files from tracking |

### First-Time Setup

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

 GitHub vs Bitbucket – Which One Should You Use?
Both use Git under the hood. The commands are the same — only the interface differs.

💼 Bitbucket is often preferred by companies due to its ability to be hosted on private servers (more security & control).

☁️ Cloud Computing: Why It's the New Normal
Cloud > Traditional Servers. Period.

Platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure offer:

⚙️ On-demand servers

💰 Reduced hardware cost

🔒 Built-in security

⏱ Speedy deployments

No more server room headaches.

🔑 Top 5 IT Foundations to Learn (ASAP)
Area	Why It Matters
A Programming Language (Python/Java)	Code is life
Linux	Powers 99% of servers
Networking	Understand IP, DNS, ports
Databases	Store & query data (MySQL, MongoDB)
Git	Collaborate & control versions like a boss

🆚 AWS vs Google Cloud Free Tier: Who Wins?
Feature	AWS	Google Cloud
Free Credits	Low	₹20,000 ($300) ✅
RAM	1 GB	6 GB ✅
Disk	30 GB	Flexible ✅
Billing	Tricky	Transparent ✅

👉 Winner: Google Cloud (especially for beginners).

⚙️ Spin Up Your First Cloud VM (Google Cloud FTW)
🔹 Steps to Create VM:
Sign up at Google Cloud

Choose Individual account

Add your card (₹50 – refunded)

Go to → Compute Engine → VM Instances → Create Instance

Choose:

OS: CentOS 7

RAM: 3.75 GB

Region: Mumbai/Singapore

Enable HTTP/HTTPS access

🎉 Boom! You’ve got your own Linux Cloud Server 💻

🔐 SSH Keys = Secure, Password-Free Login
📁 Generate SSH Keys:
mkdir keys_google
cd keys_google
ssh-keygen -f gituser

You’ll get two files:

gituser → Your private key (💀 never share)

gituser.pub → Your public key

⬆️ Upload SSH Key to Google Cloud:
Go to → Compute Engine → Metadata → SSH Keys → Add item

Paste content of gituser.pub

🔌 Connect to Your VM:
ssh -i gituser gituser@<External-IP>
💡 If there's a known_hosts error:
Delete .ssh/known_hosts file on your local system.

Then:
sudo su -

🧩 Final Thoughts
Git + Linux + Cloud = Your passport to DevOps 🚀

Whether you're switching careers or starting out, this combo is your best investment right now.

👣 Start small. Break things. Learn from chaos. That’s real DevOps.

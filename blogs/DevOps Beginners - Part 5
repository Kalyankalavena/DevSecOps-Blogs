Blog 5: VIM & User Management – Secret Tools of Every DevSecOps Pro
🧑‍💻 By Kalyan Kalavena 

✍️ What Is the VIM Editor in Linux?
VIM (Vi IMproved) is a legendary terminal-based text editor in Linux. It’s lightning-fast, purely keyboard-driven, and a favorite among system admins, developers, and DevSecOps pros for editing configuration files and code securely—directly from the terminal.

🔑 VIM Modes
ESC Mode (Default) → For navigation and command inputs.

Insert Mode → Press i to start editing text.

Command Mode → Press : to start entering commands (e.g., :wq).

📄 Common VIM Commands (Command Mode :)

:q              Quit
:wq             Save and Quit
:q!             Force Quit (discard changes)
:/word          Search from top
:?word          Search from bottom
:noh            Remove highlight
:set nu         Show line numbers
:set nonu       Hide line numbers
:28d            Delete 28th line
:3s/old/new     Replace first match in line 3
:3s/old/new/g   Replace all in line 3
:%s/old/new/g   Replace all in file
:%d             Delete all content

🧠 ESC Mode Shortcuts (Navigation + Editing)

u       Undo
yy      Copy current line
p       Paste
10p     Paste 10 times
dd      Cut current line
gg      Jump to top
Shift+G Jump to bottom
👤 Linux User Management – Real World Admin Ops
In DevSecOps, user access = security control. Here's how to manage it like a pro:

✅ Basic User Commands

useradd kalyan                Create a new user
id kalyan                     View user details
passwd kalyan                 Set a password
groupadd devops               Create a group
usermod -g devops kalyan      Set primary group
usermod -aG testing kalyan    Add secondary group
🎯 A user has one primary group, but can belong to multiple secondary groups.

❌ How to Delete a User Safely

userdel kalyan
Step-by-step:

Remove from groups

Remove from projects

Then delete user

🔐 SSH Configuration & Key-Based Login
📁 SSH Config File:

/etc/ssh/sshd_config
🔄 Service Commands

systemctl restart sshd    Restart SSH service
sshd -t                   Test SSH config syntax
🗝️ Key-Based Authentication (Secure Login Without Passwords)
Generate SSH Key Pair:

ssh-keygen -f kalyan-key
Upload .pub to server’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Keep .pem or private key secure and secret

✅ SSH keys = Login automation + military-grade security

📌 Summary: What Kalyan Learned Today
VIM is a keyboard-based, lightning-fast editor you’ll use daily.

User management helps control access and apply least-privilege policies.

SSH key auth is a DevSecOps must-have for secure automation.

🔐 Blog 6: Linux Permissions, SSH & Service Management – DevSecOps Foundations

✍️ written by Kalyan Kalavena

🧑‍💻 Why This Blog Matters
As a DevSecOps engineer, it’s not just CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes all day. You’ll regularly need to:

Control who accesses what using Linux file permissions
Securely connect to servers using SSH
Manage running services like Nginx or Jenkins
Monitor processes and troubleshoot port conflicts
This is real-world Linux stuff that makes you dangerous in a good way.

🔐 1. Linux File & Folder Permissions
🧮 Numeric Permission Codes
Symbol	Code	Meaning
r	4	Read
w	2	Write
x	1	Execute

🔍 Real Example

-rw-r--r-- 1 ec2-user ec2-user  myfile.txt
Owner → Read & Write (rw-)

Group → Read only (r--)

Others → Read only (r--)

🔧 Useful Commands

chmod o+w file.txt        # Give write to others
chmod o-r file.txt        # Remove read from others
chmod ugo+rwx file.txt    # Give all access to everyone
chmod 740 file.txt        # u: read/write/execute, g: read, o: no access

🧑‍🚀 2. SSH Key-Based Login
SSH is how you log into cloud servers without typing passwords like a noob.

🚀 Steps to Setup:
mkdir ~/.ssh
chown kalyan:kalyan ~/.ssh
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh

🔑 Login Using:
ssh -i kalyan.pem kalyan@<IP_ADDRESS>

📦 3. Package Management with DNF/YUM
Install, list, and remove packages — especially web servers, monitoring tools, or security agents.

🔧 DNF Commands
dnf install nginx -y       # Install Nginx
dnf remove nginx           # Remove Nginx
dnf list installed         # List all installed packages
dnf list available         # List what's available to install

🛠️ 4. Managing Services with systemctl
Systemd is your friend. Control all services (daemons) like this:
systemctl status sshd       # Check if SSH is running
systemctl start nginx       # Start Nginx
systemctl stop nginx        # Stop Nginx
systemctl restart nginx     # Restart Nginx
systemctl enable nginx      # Enable on boot

🔍 5. Monitoring Processes & Ports
Track what’s running and kill what’s misbehaving.
ps -ef | grep nginx         # See if Nginx is running
kill <PID>                 # Gently stop a process
kill -9 <PID>              # Force kill
netstat -lntp              # Show listening ports + which process is using them

✅ Summary – What You’ve Mastered
Skill Area	What You Can Now Do
chmod, chown	Control file and folder access
SSH	Set up password-less, secure remote access
DNF/YUM	Manage software packages on Linux
systemctl	Start, stop, restart services like a pro
ps, netstat	Monitor processes and resolve port issues

## 🚀 Why Linux is Essential in DevSecOps

If you're serious about DevSecOps, the first skill you must master is **Linux**. It powers cloud servers, automation scripts, and production environments across the world.

- **Cloud Servers**: Most use Linux OS (e.g., Ubuntu, Amazon Linux)
- **Security**: File permissions, SSH access, user control
- **Automation**: Bash scripts, cron jobs, logs
- **Speed**: Lightweight, resource-efficient

## 📂 Getting Started – File & Folder Navigation

```bash
pwd               # Show current directory  
ls                # List files  
cd foldername     # Enter folder  
cd ..             # Go back one level  
mkdir myfolder    # Create new folder  
touch file.txt    # Create an empty file  
rm file.txt       # Delete file (carefully!)

Simple Use Case

mkdir projects  
cd projects  
touch notes.txt  
ls  
# Output: notes.txt

Viewing and Editing Files

cat filename       # See file contents  
vi filename        # VIM editor  
nano filename      # Simpler editor
⚙️ Combo Command Tip

This creates a folder, enters it, and creates a file in one go!

 SSH Access & File Permissions

ssh -i <private-key-path> ec2-user@<IP>
Path Explanation:

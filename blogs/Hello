💻 Linux Server Essentials for DevOps

Keep your servers running smoothly with commands like:

Pro Tip: Understand your RAM (fast memory), swap (backup RAM), and disk storage!



⚙️ Automate Everything with Shell Scripting

Save time & reduce errors by automating tasks:



Example: A backup script that compresses your home directory and confirms completion.



Automation is your career superpower!

## 💻 What is a Computer?

- **Input → Process → Output**
- Key Components:
  - **RAM** = Temporary memory (fast app performance)
  - **Storage** = Saves files
  - **Processor (CPU)** = Main brain
  - **OS** = Software layer (Windows, Linux, etc.)

---

## 🌍Client-Server Architecture

- **Client** = Browser (you)
- **Server** = Host (e.g., facebook.com)
- **Example Flow**:
  - You type URL → Browser sends request → Server responds with site
- **Port Forwarding** = Share your local app online

---

## 🐧 What is Linux?

- **Free**, **Open Source**, **Fast**, **Secure**
- Used in most cloud servers

### ☁️ Cloud Concepts:

- **Region** = Physical location (e.g., Mumbai)
- **AZ (Availability Zone)** = Data center in region
- **Instance** = Virtual server

---

### Linux Distributions (Flavours)

- Ubuntu  
- RHEL  
- CentOS  
- Fedora  
- Android (Linux-based)

---

### Linux Internals

- **Kernel** = Core of OS (written in C)
- **User Interface** = CLI/GUI for users
- Created by **Linus Torvalds**

---

##  Firewall (Security Group)

- Controls **inbound** (who enters) & **outbound** (who exits)
- To allow all traffic: `0.0.0.0/0`

---

## What is AMI?

- **AMI = Amazon Machine Image**
- Pre-configured OS for AWS EC2 (like a .iso file)

---

## Authentication Methods

1. **What you know** – Password  
2. **What you have** – OTP / Token  
3. **What you are** – Biometrics (fingerprint, retina)

---

### 🔑 SSH Keys

- **Public Key** = Lock  
- **Private Key** = Key

**Generate Key**:
```bash
ssh-keygen -f my-key

Linux File Commands

in bash

pwd       # Show current directory
ls -l     # List files with details
cd ..     # Move one directory up

File Types:

.pub = Public key

.pem = Private key


EC2 Launch Flow (AWS)
Create SSH key pair

Upload public key to AWS

Configure firewall rules

Launch EC2 instance

SSH into instance

Terminate when done

## 🚀 Why Linux?

Linux is the backbone of DevSecOps. If you're serious about this path, Linux isn’t optional — it’s your native tongue.

Here’s why:
| Area        | Linux Role                        |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Cloud       | Most servers are Linux-based      |
| Security    | Permissions, users, hardening     |
| Automation  | Scripting, cronjobs, log parsing  |
| Performance | Lightweight and fast              |

## 📂 File & Folder Basics

```bash
pwd                # Show current directory
ls                 # List files
cd folder          # Go into folder
cd ..              # Go up one level
mkdir newfolder    # Make a folder
touch file.txt     # Make a file
rm file.txt        # Delete a file

👨‍💻 Real-Time Mini Task

mkdir projects
cd projects
touch notes.txt
ls
📝 Output: notes.txt

🛠️ File Viewing & Editing

cat file.txt       # Show contents
vi file.txt        # Use VIM (powerful)
nano file.txt      # Use Nano (simple)

🧠 Combine Commands Like a Pro

mkdir logs && cd logs && touch app.log
🎯 One-liner to:

Create folder

Enter it

Make a file

🔐 User Access Levels
Symbol	Access Level
$	Normal User
#	Root/Admin


sudo su        # Switch to root
sudo su -      # Full root access

📂 Listing Variants

ls -l      # Detailed list
ls -lt     # Latest files first
ls -ltr    # Oldest files first
ls -la     # Show hidden files

🌍 Download Files

wget https://example.com/file.zip
curl https://example.com
curl -o myfile.txt https://example.com

🔎 Search, Filter, Extract

grep "root" /etc/passwd              # Search keyword
cut -d ":" -f1 /etc/passwd           # Show usernames
awk -F ":" '{print $1}' /etc/passwd # Same as above
find / -name "file.txt"             # Find file system-wide

☁️ Connect to EC2 (AWS)

# 1. Generate key
# 2. Import to AWS
# 3. Set firewall (security group)
# 4. Launch EC2
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-ip
# 5. Terminate when done
✅ Summary
Linux is your DevSecOps toolkit starter pack. Know it, type it, breathe it.

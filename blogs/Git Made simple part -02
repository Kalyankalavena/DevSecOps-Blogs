If you're starting your journey into DevOps or cloud computing, you're probably hearing a lot of terms: **Git**, **Bitbucket**, **Cloud VMs**, **SSH keys**, **AWS**, **Google Cloud**... it can feel overwhelming.

Don’t worry — this is your friendly guide to understand how all these pieces connect and why they matter.

## 🧠 Why Version Control Systems Like Git Are Essential

Ever lost a file because you forgot to save the backup? Or clashed with a teammate editing the same document?

That’s what **Version Control Systems (VCS)** solve. They:

- Track every change in your files.
- Let multiple people work on the same project.
- Allow you to roll back to older versions if needed.

### 🪜 VCS Evolution Made Simple:

- **1st Gen (Locking systems):** Only one person could work on a file at a time.
- **2nd Gen (Centralized like SVN):** You get a working copy, but no local history.
- **3rd Gen (Distributed like Git):** Everyone has a full copy and can work offline!

> 💬 "Git gives you speed, safety, and collaboration — all in one."

## 🛠️ Must-Know Git Commands

Here’s your cheat sheet:

| Command | What It Does |
|--------|---------------|
| `git init` | Start a new Git project |
| `git add <file>` | Stage file changes |
| `git commit -m "msg"` | Save changes with a message |
| `git push origin master` | Upload code to remote repo |
| `git status` | Check file changes |
| `git log` | View commit history |
| `.gitignore` | Skip files you don’t want tracked |

**First-time setup:**

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

🔄 GitHub vs Bitbucket – Which One to Use?
Both platforms are built on Git. The commands stay the same — only the interface is different.

💼 Companies often prefer Bitbucket over GitHub because it can be installed on their own secure servers. That means more control and privacy.

☁️ Why Cloud Computing is the Future (And Present)
Gone are the days of maintaining huge physical servers. Today, companies use cloud platforms like:

AWS

Google Cloud

Microsoft Azure

Benefits of the cloud:

Lower hardware costs.

Better security.

Instant server launch.

Focus on code, not infrastructure setup.

🔑 5 Tech Basics You Must Learn (for Any IT Job)
A Programming Language (e.g., Python, Java)

Operating System (Linux is preferred)

Networking (IP, DNS, ports)

Databases (MySQL, MongoDB)

Git (Version Control)

🆚 AWS vs Google Cloud: Which Free Tier Is Better?
Feature	AWS	Google Cloud
Free Credits	Low	₹20,000 ($300)
RAM	1 GB	6 GB
Disk	30 GB	Flexible
Charges	May surprise you	Transparent billing

👀 Tip: Google Cloud offers more RAM and beginner-friendly billing.

🛠️ How to Create Your Own Cloud VM (Step-by-Step)
Sign up at Google Cloud → Choose Individual account.

Add your card (₹50 is temporarily charged and refunded).

Go to Compute Engine → VM Instances → Create Instance

Choose:

OS: CentOS 7

RAM: 3.75 GB

Region: Mumbai/Singapore

Enable HTTP/HTTPS access

🎉 You’ve just created your own Linux cloud server!

🔐 Secure Server Access with SSH Keys (No Passwords!)
Step 1: Generate SSH Keys 

mkdir keys_google
cd keys_google
ssh-keygen -f gituser
This gives you two files:

gituser → Your private key (keep it safe!)

gituser.pub → Your public key

Step 2: Upload to Google Cloud
Go to Compute Engine → Metadata → SSH Keys

Click Add Item and paste gituser.pub

Step 3: Connect to VM
ssh -i gituser gituser@<External-IP>
If there's an error about known_hosts, delete .ssh/known_hosts from your system.

Once connected, switch to root:
sudo su -

## 🚀 Welcome to My DevSecOps Journey!

Hello and welcome!

I’m **Kalyan**, and I’m so excited to have you here. I’ve always had a deep passion for learning new skills, and this blog is my way of sharing the things that inspire and motivate me. Whether you’re just beginning your tech journey or are looking to dive deeper into **DevOps** and **DevSecOps**, you’re in the right place.

> 🙏 Let me introduce the person who changed my life:  
**Sivakumar**, a professional with **13 years of experience** in the IT industry (as of july 2025).  
Under his guidance, I started learning **DevSecOps from scratch**.  
Before his course, I was a complete beginner — a **non-IT professional** who didn’t even know what DevOps was.  
Today, I proudly stand on the shoulders of that transformation.
